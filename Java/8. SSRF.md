Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a critical security vulnerability that can compromise application's internal infrastructure. SSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to make requests from the server to internal or external resources, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure. 
#### What is SSRF?

SSRF occurs when an attacker can manipulate a server to send HTTP requests to internal or external resources that the server can access. This can lead to various security issues, including:

- **Accessing Internal Services**: Attackers might access internal services or databases that are not intended to be exposed.
- **Bypassing Firewall Rules**: Requests from the server might bypass firewall rules that would normally protect internal resources.
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive information from internal systems can be leaked.

#### Insecure Code : 

Consider a web application that fetches a resource based on user input:

```java
public Response fetchResource(@QueryParam("url") String url) {
    try {
        URL resourceUrl = new URL(url);
        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) resourceUrl.openConnection();
        InputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();
        // Read and process the input stream
        return Response.ok().entity(inputStream).build();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        return Response.status(Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).build();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `fetchResource` method takes a URL as a query parameter and fetches the resource from that URL. However, this code is vulnerable to SSRF attacks. An attacker could provide a URL that points to an internal service or even a local file, potentially accessing unauthorized resources.

#### Example of Exploitation

An attacker might exploit this vulnerability by providing a URL like:

```
http://localhost/admin
```

If `localhost` points to an internal admin interface, the attacker could gain access to sensitive internal resources.

### Solution: Validating and Restricting URLs

To mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities, you should implement strict validation and restrictions on the URLs that your application is allowed to request. Here are some strategies:

1. **Whitelist Allowed URLs**: Only allow requests to known and trusted domains. For example, you could maintain a whitelist of allowed URLs or domains.

2. **Block Internal IPs and Localhost**: Ensure that requests to internal IP addresses (e.g., `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`) are blocked.

3. **Limit URL Scheme**: Restrict the URL schemes to only those that are necessary, such as `http` and `https`.

4. **Validate URL Format**: Ensure that the URL conforms to expected formats and is properly sanitized.

####  Secure Code

```java
public Response fetchResource(@QueryParam("url") String url) {
    // Validate and sanitize the URL
    if (!isValidUrl(url)) {
        return Response.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST).build();
    }

    try {
        URL resourceUrl = new URL(url);
        // Ensure the URL is not internal
        if (isInternalUrl(resourceUrl)) {
            return Response.status(Response.Status.FORBIDDEN).build();
        }

        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) resourceUrl.openConnection();
        InputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();
        // Read and process the input stream
        return Response.ok().entity(inputStream).build();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        return Response.status(Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).build();
    }
}

private boolean isValidUrl(String url) {
    // Implement URL validation logic, e.g., checking for allowed schemes and formats
    return url != null && (url.startsWith("http://") || url.startsWith("https://"));
}

private boolean isInternalUrl(URL url) {
    // Block internal IP addresses and localhost
    String host = url.getHost();
    return host.equals("localhost") || host.startsWith("127.") || host.startsWith("192.168.") || host.startsWith("10.");
}
```

#### Best Practices for Preventing SSRF

1. **URL Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation of URLs to ensure they conform to expected patterns and are not pointing to internal services.

2. **Access Controls**: Apply access controls to restrict which resources the server can access based on the requestâ€™s origin.

3. **Security Testing**: Regularly test your application for SSRF vulnerabilities as part of your security testing practices.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitor and log network traffic and request patterns to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

5. **Firewall and Network Segmentation** : Have firewall and network segmentation in place so that internal locations cannot be accessed from outside the network.
