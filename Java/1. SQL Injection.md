SQL injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application or webpage uses user input directly in SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization. Malicious users can exploit this weakness by inserting specially crafted input that alters the intended SQL query.

```
// Java Program (Vulnerable)
public List<UserAccount> getUserAccountsByEmail(String email) throws SQLException {
    // Not secure
    String query = "SELECT user_id, account_number, balance FROM UserAccounts WHERE email = '"
            + email + "'";

    Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);

    // Further processing
}
```
#### Understanding SQL Injection Payload

Now, letâ€™s explore an SQL injection payload example: Suppose a malicious user inputs the following payload in the `email` field:

```sql
user@example.com' OR '1'='1';--
```

#### Manipulated Query:

When this payload is injected, the resulting SQL query becomes something like this:

```sql
SELECT user_id, account_number, balance 
FROM UserAccounts 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com' OR '1'='1';--
```

#### Breakdown:

- **`user@example.com'`**: Closes the original string literal in the query.
- **`OR '1'='1'`**: Introduces an always-true condition, effectively bypassing the `WHERE` clause.
- **`;--`**: The `;` ends the current query, and `--` comments out the rest of the SQL statement, ignoring any subsequent logic.

This manipulation means that the query will return all records from the `UserAccounts` table, potentially exposing all user accounts, regardless of the actual email value.

#### Fixed Code:

```java
public List<UserAccount> findAccountsByUserEmail(String email) 
	throws SQLException 
{ 
	String sql = "SELECT user_id, account_number, balance FROM UserAccounts WHERE email = ?"; //use of parameterized query

	Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();
	PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql); //use of prepared statements
	pstmt.setString(1, email);
	ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
}
```


- **Prepared Statements**: The code now uses a `PreparedStatement` instead of a regular `Statement`. This approach allows the SQL query to be compiled separately from the user input, which prevents the possibility of injecting malicious SQL code.
  
- **Parameterized Query**: The `?` placeholder in the query is a parameter that gets securely replaced with the actual value of `email` using the `pstmt.setString(1, email)` method. This ensures that the input is treated strictly as a data value and not as part of the SQL code.

- **Prevention of SQL Injection**: By using prepared statements and parameterized queries, the application prevents SQL injection attacks because the input values are automatically escaped and cannot alter the structure of the SQL query.

This secure method ensures that the query only fetches records associated with the exact email provided by the user, thus maintaining the integrity and security of the application.
