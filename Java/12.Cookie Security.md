When managing cookies in web applications, ensuring their security is crucial to protecting user data and preventing various attacks. Two important flags to consider are `Secure` and `HttpOnly`, which play significant roles in cookie security. 
#### **The Importance of `Secure` and `HttpOnly` Flags**

1. **`Secure` Flag**: This flag ensures that the cookie is only sent over secure (HTTPS) connections. Without this flag, cookies may be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, making them vulnerable to interception and attacks.

2. **`HttpOnly` Flag**: This flag restricts access to the cookie from client-side scripts. By setting this flag, you prevent malicious scripts from accessing the cookie data, which helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

#### **Example of Vulnerable Code**

Consider the following code snippet where a cookie is created and added to the response:

```java
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("userName", userName);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```

In this example, the cookie is created without setting the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags, which leaves it exposed to potential security risks.

#### **Solution: Secure Cookie Configuration**

To enhance cookie security, configure the cookie with the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags:

```java
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("userName", userName);
cookie.setSecure(true); // Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS
cookie.setHttpOnly(true); // Prevents access from client-side scripts
response.addCookie(cookie);
```

In this updated code:
- **`cookie.setSecure(true)`**: Ensures that the cookie is transmitted only over secure (HTTPS) connections.
- **`cookie.setHttpOnly(true)`**: Prevents the cookie from being accessed by JavaScript, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

#### **Alternative Solution: Servlet 3.0 Configuration**

For applications using Servlet 3.0 or higher, you can set default cookie security settings in the `web.xml` configuration file:

```xml
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" version="3.0">
    [...]
    <session-config>
        <cookie-config>
            <http-only>true</http-only>
            <secure>true</secure>
        </cookie-config>
    </session-config>
</web-app>
```

In this configuration:
- **`<http-only>true</http-only>`**: Ensures that all cookies are created with the `HttpOnly` flag.
- **`<secure>true</secure>`**: Ensures that all cookies are created with the `Secure` flag.

#### **Conclusion**

Properly configuring cookies with the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags is essential for securing web applications and protecting user data. By setting these flags, you ensure that cookies are transmitted securely and are not accessible via client-side scripts.
