When developing APIs, one common security risk developers must be wary of is the possibility of directory traversal attacks. This occurs when user input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths and gain unauthorized access to files. 

#### The Problem

Let's say you're building an API that allows users to download files by specifying a filename. If you accept the filename directly from the user and pass it to the API without proper validation, you're opening the door to potential security issues.

Consider the following vulnerable code:

```java
@GET     // HTTP GET method
@Path("/files/{filename}")    // User-controlled path parameter
@Produces("application/octet-stream")  // Returns file as a binary stream
public Response getFile(@javax.ws.rs.PathParam("filename") String filename) {
    File file = new File("data/files/", filename); // Vulnerable to path traversal attacks
    // Example of manipulation: ../another_directory/secret.txt
	
    if (!file.exists()) {
        return Response.status(Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    }

    return Response.ok().entity(new FileInputStream(file)).build();  // Returns file content if it exists
}
```

In this example, an attacker could potentially manipulate the `filename` parameter by using relative paths (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended directory, such as `../another_directory/secret.txt`. If the file exists on the server, the API would return its contents, leading to unauthorized access.

#### The Solution

To mitigate this risk, it's essential to sanitize user inputs, ensuring that only valid and safe file paths are used. A good approach is to use the `FilenameUtils.getName()` method from the Apache Commons IO library, which extracts only the file's name, stripping out any directory traversal elements.

Hereâ€™s how the code looks after applying the fix:

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;

@GET
@Path("/files/{filename}")
@Produces("application/octet-stream")
public Response getFile(@javax.ws.rs.PathParam("filename") String filename) {
    String sanitizedFilename = FilenameUtils.getName(filename); // Sanitize the filename
    // Prevents directory traversal: ../another_directory/secret.txt -> secret.txt

    File file = new File("data/files/", sanitizedFilename); // Safe file path
    
    if (!file.exists()) {
        return Response.status(Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    }

    return Response.ok().entity(new FileInputStream(file)).build();
}
```

In this improved version, `FilenameUtils.getName(filename)` ensures that only the actual filename is considered, preventing an attacker from using directory traversal techniques to access unintended files. This simple but effective step helps secure your application from one of the most common file access vulnerabilities.

#### Conclusion

Always remember that user input should never be trusted. By properly sanitizing file paths and other inputs, you can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches in your APIs. Implementing libraries like Apache Commons IO for sanitization is an easy and effective way to enhance your application's security.
